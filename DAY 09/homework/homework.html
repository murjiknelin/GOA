<h1>hello world</h1>

<p> Spider-Man's secret identity is Peter Benjamin Parker. Initially, Peter was depicted as a 
    teenage high-school student and an orphan raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York
     City after his parents, Richard and Mary Parker, died in a plane crash. Lee, Ditko, and 
     later creators had the character deal with the struggles of adolescence and young adulthood
      and gave him many supporting characters, such as Flash Thompson, J. Jonah Jameson, and Harry
       Osborn; romantic interests Gwen Stacy, Mary Jane Watson, and the Black Cat; and enemies such as 
       Doctor Octopus, the Green Goblin, and Venom. In his origin story, Spider-Man gets his superhuman 
       spider powers and abilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider. These powers include superhuman
        strength, agility, reflexes, stamina, durability, coordination, and balance; clinging to surfaces and 
        ceilings like a spider; and detecting danger with his precognition ability called "spider-sense". He 
        builds wrist-mounted "web-shooter" devices that shoot artificial spider-webs of his own design, which 
        he uses both for fighting and web-swinging across the city. Peter Parker initially used his powers for
         his personal gain, but after his Uncle Ben was killed by a thief that Peter could not stop, he began to 
         use his powers to fight crime by becoming Spider-Man. </p>
