<h4>Spider-Man’s powers</h4>
<p>Spider-Man has spider-like abilities including superhuman strength and the ability to
     cling to most surfaces. He is also extremely agile and has amazing reflexes. Spider-Man also has a “spider sense,” that warns him of impending danger.
    Spider-Man has supplemented his powers with technology. Being a brilliant chemist and scie
    ntist, Peter has made web-slingers, bracelets that shoot out a sticky webbing, allowing him to swing from building 
    to building and ensnare opponents. He has also developed stingers that shoot powerful energy blasts that can stun foes.
    In the recent storyline, Spider-Man has been reborn with even stronger abilities.
     He has the ability to see in the dark, enhanced senses, and can feel the vibrations through his webbing. In addition to this, the new, “Iron Spidey,” suit has enhanced his strength furt
    her and gives protection from damage. Recently, however, he has gotten rid of the suit and returned to the classic costume.</p>
