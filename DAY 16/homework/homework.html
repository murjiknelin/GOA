<h3 style="color:aliceblue background-color black  ;  text-align: center;" >J. Robert Oppenheimer</h3>

<p>J. Robert Oppenheimer (born April 22, 1904, New York, New York, U.S.—died February 18, 1967, Princeton, New Jersey) was an American theoretical physicist and science administrator,
     noted as director of the Los Alamos Laboratory (1943–45) during development of the atomic bomb and as director of the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton (1947–66).
      Accusations of disloyalty led to a government hearing that resulted in the loss of his security clearance and of his position as adviser to the highest echelons of the U.S. government. 
    The case became a cause célèbre in the world of science because of its implications concerning political and moral issues relating to the role of scientists in government.</p>

<h3 style="color:aliceblue background-color black  ;  text-align: center;">Early life and education</h3>

<p>Oppenheimer was the son of a German immigrant who had made his fortune by importing textiles in New York City.
     During his undergraduate studies at Harvard University, Oppenheimer excelled in Latin, Greek, physics, and chemistry,
      published poetry, and studied Eastern philosophy. After graduating in 1925, he sailed for England to do research at the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge,
       which, under the leadership of Lord Ernest Rutherford, had an international reputation for its pioneering studies on atomic structure.
        At the Cavendish, Oppenheimer had the opportunity to collaborate with the British scientific community in its efforts to advance the cause of atomic research.

<p>The rise of Adolf Hitler in Germany stirred his first interest in politics. In 1936 he sided with the republic during the Civil War in Spain, where he became acquainted with communist students.
     Although his father’s death in 1937 left Oppenheimer a fortune that allowed him to subsidize anti-fascist organizations,
     the tragic suffering inflicted by Joseph Stalin on Russian scientists led him to withdraw his associations with the Communist Party—in fact,
      he never joined the party—and at the same time reinforced in him a liberal democratic philosophy. In 1939, Oppenheimer began an affair with Katharine Puening,
       a graduate student in botany at the University of California, Los Angeles. Puening divorced her husband and married Oppenheimer in 1940.

    After the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany in 1939, the physicists Albert Einstein, Leo Szilard, and Eugene Wigner warned the U.S.
     government of the danger threatening all of humanity if the Nazis should be the first to make a nuclear bomb. Oppenheimer then began to seek a process for the separation of uranium-235 from natural uranium and to determine the critical mass of uranium required to make such a bomb.
      In August 1942 the U.S. Army was given the responsibility of organizing the efforts of British and U.S.
       physicists to seek a way to harness nuclear energy for military purposes, an effort that became known as the Manhattan Project.
     Oppenheimer was instructed to establish and administer a laboratory to carry out this assignment.
      In 1943 he chose the plateau of Los Alamos, near Santa Fe, New Mexico.</p>

<h3 style="color:aliceblue background-color black  ;  text-align: center;">Oppenheimer’s legacy</h3>

<p>In 1963 U.S. Pres. Lyndon B. Johnson presented Oppenheimer with the Enrico Fermi Award of the Atomic Energy Commission. 
    Oppenheimer retired from the Institute for Advanced Study in 1966 and died of throat cancer the following year. 
    In 2014, 60 years after the proceedings that effectively ended Oppenheimer’s career, the U.S. Department of Energy released the full,
     declassified transcript of the hearing. While many of the details were already known,
      the newly released material bolstered Oppenheimer’s assertions of loyalty and reinforced the perception that a brilliant scientist had been brought low by a bureaucratic cocktail of professional jealousy and McCarthyism. 
      In 2022 the Department of Energy formally vacated the revocation of Oppenheimer’s security clearance. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm claimed that the “bias and unfairness” of a “flawed process” had led to his exile from the nuclear establishment.
       Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer (2023), cast Cillian Murphy in the title role of a film that explored Oppenheimer’s role in the development of the atomic bomb and the events that led to the 1954 security hearing.
